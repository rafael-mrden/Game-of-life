#gameoflife.py

'''In this module I wrote several function that generate Conway's Game of life:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

This was a project for the course "Advanced Scientific Programming in Python", 23-27 March 2020, Uppsala University.

Note: When running in Jupyter Notebook, one should add "%matplotlib notebook".

KNOWN BUGS:
- Matrix that has all entries 1 is drawn all in blue. This is the same as the matrix with all entries 0. This is a problem in "matplotlib.pyplot", and I should check color setting there. It does not affect Game of life much, since such a matrix would die anyway, just one step later.'''
